    <h3>Call for Papers</h3>
    <div class="overview">
<p>Privacy and security are becoming a key concern in our digital age. Companies and organizations are collecting a wealth of data on a daily basis. Data owners have to be very cautious while exploiting the values in the data, since the most useful data for machine learning often tend to be confidential. Increasingly strict data privacy regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) bring new legislative challenges to the big data and artificial intelligence (AI) community. Many operations in the big data domain, such as merging user data from various sources for building an AI model, will be considered illegal under the new regulatory framework if they are performed without explicit user authorization.

<p>In order to explore how the AI research community can adapt to this new regulatory reality, we organize this one-day workshop in conjunction with the <a href="https://ijcai-21.org/" target="_blank">30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI'21)</a>. The workshop will focus on machine learning systems adhering to the privacy-preserving and security principles. Technical issues include but not limit to data collection, integration, training and modelling, both in the centralized and distributed setting. The workshop intends to provide a forum to discuss the open problems and share the most recent and ground-breaking work on the study and application of secure and privacy-preserving compliant machine learning. Both theoretical and application-based contributions are welcome. The FL-series workshops seek to explore new ideas with particular focus on addressing the following challenges:
<ul>
<li>Security and Regulation Compliance: How to meet the security and compliance requirements? Does the solution ensure data privacy and model security?</li>
<li>Collaboration and Expansion Solution: Does the solution connect different business partners from various parties and industries? Does the solution exploit and extend the value of data while observing user privacy and data security?</li>
<li>Promotion & Empowerment: Is the solution sustainable and intelligent? Does it include incentive mechanisms to encourage parties to participate on a continuous basis? Does it promote a stable and win-win business ecosystem?</li>
</ul>

<p>We welcome submissions on recent advances in privacy-preserving, secure machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. All accepted papers will be presented during the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to represent it at the workshop. Topics include but not limit to: 

<p>Techniques 
<ol>
<li>Adversarial learning, data poisoning, adversarial examples, adversarial robustness, black box attacks</li>
<li>Architecture and privacy-preserving learning protocols</li>
<li>Automated federated learning</li>
<li>Federated learning and distributed privacy-preserving algorithms</li>
<li>Federated transfer learning</li>
<li>Human-in-the-loop for privacy-aware machine learning</li>
<li>Incentive mechanism and game theory</li>
<li>Privacy aware knowledge driven federated learning</li>
<li>Privacy-preserving techniques (secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, secret sharing techniques, differential privacy) for machine learning</li>
<li>Responsible, explainable and interpretability of AI</li>
<li>Security for privacy</li>
<li>Trade-off between privacy and efficiency</li>
<li>Heterogeneous computing systems for federated learning</li>
</ol>

<p>Applications
<ol>
<li>Approaches to make AI GDPR-compliant</li>
<li>Crowd intelligence</li>
<li>Data value and economics of data federation</li>
<li>Open-source frameworks for distributed learning</li>
<li>Safety and security assessment of AI solutions</li>
<li>Solutions to data security and small-data challenges in industries</li>
<li>Standards of data privacy and security</li>
</ol>

<p>Position, perspective, and vision papers are also welcome.
